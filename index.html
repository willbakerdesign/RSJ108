Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

Add your introduction to your step-by-step-guide, including a title, time required to complete the activity, and a rating of how awesome the activity is.

            <p>Photography is an amazing art. It can be a passion, profession and leisure activity. If you've mastered the basics of framing, shooting, and taking a photograph, try taking it further. Make it a hobby, or maybe even a career, rather than taking only the usual holiday, pet, and kid snapshots. It is time to start making stunning, rather than simply passable, photographs. Follow the described journey to develop your photography skills.<p>

              <h3>Find someone who is able to help you buy a good usable camera.</h3>
              <p>Maybe your dad or a photographer friend has a redundant film SLR kicking around. If you don't have a camera, borrow one until you can buy one. Nearly any digital camera from the last decade, and nearly any film camera ever made, will be good enough to get you great shots. Having your own camera will be an immense help.</p>

              <h3>Learn the basics, if you haven't already.</h3>
              <p>Basics of photography include composition, which is essentially the placing of a subject within the frame of a photograph, lighting, and the basic workings of your camera.</p>

              <h3>Be ready.</h3>
              <p>At least half of the time, the difference between a great photograph and a mediocre one is being in the right place at the right time, with a camera in your hand. Carry your camera with you as often as you can. Make sure to use your camera often, too. Just carrying it around does no good.</p>

              <p>Get up, get out there and take photographs. Go out at every time of day, every day, and look for things. Don't wait for the right opportunity to come along (but be prepared if it does!); go out and find them. Look for opportunities everywhere you go (whether you're at the mall or on the other side of the world), and go to places to look for opportunities. If you can see something in your mind, chances are you can set it up and shoot it!</p>

          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Keep your photos as simple as possible.</h3>
              <p>Get as close to your subject as you can. Use your feet, and use your zoom lens (if you have one) to fine-tune your composition. Get rid of anything that doesn't give some important context to understand your photo fully.</p>
              
          <!-- A new step -->
          <li>
            <div class="content">
              <h3>Shoot film.</h3>
              <p>If you already shoot film, then shoot digital as well. Both film and digital cameras have their place in the learning photographer's arsenal. They both have their advantages and disadvantages, and both will teach you a different set of habits. The worst habits of digital, are balanced out by the better habits of film, and vice versa.</p>

              <p>This doesn't mean merely technically impeccable; any (very rich) clown can stick a 400mm f/2.8 lens onto a $3000 digital SLR, get a well-exposed, super-sharp photograph of a bird, and that still won't make them Steve Cirone. Rather, look for work that makes you smile, laugh, cry, or feel anything, and not work that makes you think "well exposed and focused". If you're into people photos, look at the work of Steve McCurry (photographer of the Afghan Girl), or the studio work of Annie Leibowitz.</p>
